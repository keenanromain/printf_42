# printf_42
A personal printf with full-functionality

## Key Details

This project was a great excercise for understanding variable argument lists in C and the full power behind printf's many flags and format identifiers. The first function to be addressed, *run_thru_string*, gives a glimpse into how this project is organized:

The format string here runs similar to how the string in a simple <a href="https://github.com/keenanromain/printf_42/blob/master/src/libft/ft_putstr.c">putstr</a> would. This is achieved by outputting each character through the write system call as long as each character is valid and not a format identifier (subsequences beginning with %). If the loop does encounters a % however, the additional arguments are formatted and inserted in the resulting string where their respective specifiers would have been. To view the many format identifier's, please refer to the image below:
