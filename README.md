# printf_42
A personal printf with full-functionality. This project was a great excercise in understanding how variable arguments work in C and how versatile the printf function is through it's many flags and format identifiers. The aim for this README is to give a concise explanation of the project's most important features and other points of interest.
## Key Details

 The first function to be addressed, *run_thru_string*, gives a glimpse into how this project is organized through the loop found on line 43:

The format string runs similar to how a string in a simple <a href="https://github.com/keenanromain/printf_42/blob/master/src/libft/ft_putstr.c">putstr</a> would. Basically, each character is outputted through the write system call as long as said character is not null. However, printf would not be printf if not for the formatting capabilities so the while loop also checks for format identifiers (subsequences beginning with %). If the loop does encounters a %, the additional arguments fed to the function are properly formatted and inserted into the resulting string where their respective specifiers would have been. To view the many types of format identifiers, please refer to the image below:
